# MY PORTFOLIO

# Reversi Board Game

Reversi Rules: https://www.mastersofgames.com/rules/reversi-othello-rules.htm

Description: Collaboration with three other student programmers where Reversi game logic was implemented in a GUI and TUI. For the development of the game logic, object-oriented programming was fundamental, as the use of abstract classes, inheritance, and properties were used to represent the board, pieces, and players. I was also tasked with the GUI of the game, where I had to quickly learn many built-in functions and objects from the "pygame" library to build a grid, colored pieces, and score counters.

Team members:
- Esteban Arellano (GUI)
- Diana Chu (TUI): 
- Riyush Thakur (Bot)
- Andrew Matute (QA)

Enhancements
- added alternate library to the TUI to support more than 9 colors
- added music to the GUI (this enhancement only works on mac, not on windows)
- added start screen on the GUI
- added a player piece counter that updates on GUI; it is never recaculated
since it is stored in an attribute in the Reversi class as a dictionary,
mapping player number to counter.

# Maze Game Text User Interface

Description: Collaboration with another programmer where a TUI maze was constructed using object-oriented programming, BFS and DFS algorithms, and game scripting on Python. In essence, the program converts mazes represented in text files into a playable game with varying difficulties. A maze solver program is also included in the project.
